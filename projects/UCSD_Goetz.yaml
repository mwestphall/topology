Description: Emerging machine learning (ML) models enable the design
  of atomistic interaction potentials for molecular simulations that
  are both accurate and computationally efficient. Training of these ML
  models requires a large number of reference data in form of energies and
  nuclear forces of relevant molecular conformations and intermolecular
  interactions. This project will compute accurate quantum mechanical
  reference energies and forces using density functional theory and
  coupled cluster theory of relevance for chemical and biomolecular
  simulations.
